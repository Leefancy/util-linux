*--annotation*[**=**_when_]::
Adds an annotation to column header names which can be printed as a
tooltip by supporting terminals. The optional _when_ argument can be
*always*, *never*, or *auto*. If the argument is omitted, it defaults to
*auto*, which means that annotations will only be used when the output
goes to a terminal.
